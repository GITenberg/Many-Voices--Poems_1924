<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>THE
RETURN</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> grass was gray
with the moonlit dew,<br />
The stones were white as I came through;<br />
I came down the path by the thirteen yews,<br />
Through the blocks of shade that the moonlight hews.<br />
And when I came to the high lych-gate<br />
I waited awhile where the corpses wait;<br />
Then I came down the road where the moonlight lay<br />
Like the fallen ghost of the light of day.</p>
<p class="poetry">The bats shrieked high in their zigzag
flight,<br />
The owls&rsquo; spread wings were quiet and white,<br />
The wind and the poplar gave sigh for sigh,<br />
And all about were the rustling shy<br />
Little live creatures that love the night&mdash;<br />
Little wild creatures timid and free.<br />
I passed, and they were not afraid of me.</p>
<p class="poetry">It was over the meadow and down the lane<br />
The way to come to my house again:<br />
Through the wood where the lovers talk,<br />
And the ghosts, they say, get leave to walk.<br />
I wore the clothes that we all must wear,<br />
And no one saw me walking there,<br />
No one saw my pale feet pass<br />
By my garden path to my garden grass.<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>My garden
was hung with the veil of spring&mdash;<br />
Plum-tree and pear-tree blossoming;<br />
It lay in the moon&rsquo;s cold sheet of light<br />
In garlands and silence, wondrous and white<br />
As a dead bride decked for her burying.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I saw the face of my house<br />
Held close in the arms of the blossomed boughs:<br />
I leaned my face to the window bright<br />
To feel if the heart of my house beat right.<br />
The firelight hung it with fitful gold;<br />
It was warm as the house of the dead is cold.<br />
I saw the settles, the candles tall,<br />
The black-faced presses against the wall,<br />
Polished beechwood and shining brass,<br />
The gleam of china, the glitter of glass,<br />
All the little things that were home to me&mdash;<br />
Everything as it used to be.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I said, &ldquo;The fire of life still
burns,<br />
And I have returned whence none returns:<br />
I will warm my hands where the fire is lit,<br />
I will warm my heart in the heart of it!&rdquo;<br />
So I called aloud to the one within:<br />
&ldquo;Open, open, and let me in!<br />
Let me in to the fire and the light&mdash;<br />
It is very cold out here in the night!&rdquo;<br />
There was never a stir or an answering breath&mdash;<br />
Only a silence as deep as death.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I beat on the window, and called, and
cried.<br />
No one heard me, and none replied.<br />
The golden silence lay warm and deep,<br />
And I wept as the dead, forgotten, weep;<br />
And there was no one to hear or see&mdash;<br />
To comfort me, to have pity on me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>But deep in the silence something stirred&mdash;<br />
Something that had not seen or heard&mdash;<br />
And two drew near to the window-pane,<br />
Kissed in the moonlight and kissed again,<br />
And looked, through my face, to the moon-shroud, spread<br />
Over the garlanded garden bed;<br />
And&mdash;&ldquo;How ghostly the moonlight is!&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p class="poetry">Back through the garden, the wood, the lane,<br
/>
I came to mine own place again.<br />
I wore the garments we all must wear,<br />
And no one saw me walking there.<br />
No one heard my thin feet pass<br />
Through the white of the stones and the gray of the grass,<br />
Along the path where the moonlight hews<br />
Slabs of shadow for thirteen yews.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the hollow where drifted dreams lie deep<br
/>
It is good to sleep: it was good to sleep:<br />
But my bed has grown cold with the drip of the dew,<br />
And I cannot sleep as I used to do.</p>
<h2><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>FOR
DOLLY<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WHO DOES NOT LEARN HER LESSONS</span></h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">You</span> see the fairies
dancing in the fountain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Laughing, leaping, sparkling with the spray;<br />
You see the gnomes, at work beneath the mountain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make gold and silver and diamonds every day;<br />
You see the angels, sliding down the moonbeams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring white dreams like sheaves of lilies fair;<br
/>
You see the imps, scarce seen against the moonbeams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rise from the bonfire&rsquo;s blue and liquid
air.</p>
<p class="poetry">All the enchantment, all the magic there is<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hid in trees and blossoms, to you is plain and
true.<br />
Dewdrops in lupin leaves are jewels for the fairies;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Every flower that blows is a miracle for you.<br />
Air, earth, water, fire, spread their splendid wares for you.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions of magics beseech your little looks;<br />
Every soul your winged soul meets, loves you and cares for
you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! why must we clip those wings and dim those eyes
with books?</p>
<p class="poetry">Soon, soon enough the magic lights grow
dimmer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Marsh mists arise to cloud the radiant sky,<br />
Dust of hard highways will veil the starry glimmer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tired hands will lay the folded magic by.<br />
Storm winds will blow through those enchanted closes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fairies be crushed where weed and briar grow strong
. . .<br />
Leave her her crown of magic stars and roses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave her her kingdom&mdash;she will not keep it
long!</p>
<h2><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>QUESTIONS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">What</span> do the roses
do, mother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the summer&rsquo;s done?<br />
They lie in the bed that is hung with red<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dream about the sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">What do the lilies do, mother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that there&rsquo;s no more June?<br />

DAISIES</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> the great green
park with the wooden palings&mdash;<br />
The wooden palings so hard to climb,<br />
There are fern and foxglove, primrose and violet,<br />
And green things growing all the time;<br />
And out in the open the daisies grow,<br />
Pretty and proud in their proper places,<br />
Millions of white-frilled daisy faces,<br />
Millions and millions&mdash;not one or two.<br />
And they call to the bluebells down in the wood:<br />
&ldquo;Are you out&mdash;are you in?&nbsp; We have been so
good<br />
All the school-time winter through,<br />
But now it&rsquo;s playtime,<br />
The gay time, the May time;<br />
We are out and at play.&nbsp; Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">In the gritty garden inside the railings,<br />
The spiky railings all painted green,<br />
There are neat little beds of geraniums and fuchsia<br />
With never a happy weed between.<br />
There&rsquo;s a neat little grass plot, bald in places,<br />
And very dusty to touch;<br />
A respectable man comes once a week<br />
To keep the garden weeded and swept,<br />
To keep it as we don&rsquo;t want it kept.<br />
He cuts the grass with his mowing-machine,<br />
And we think he cuts it too much.<br />
But even on the lawn, all dry and gritty,<br />
The daisies play about.<br />
They are so brave as well as so pretty,<br />
You cannot keep them out.<br />
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>I love
them, I want to let them grow,<br />
But that respectable man says no.<br />
He cuts off their heads with his mowing-machine<br />
Like the French Revolution guillotine.<br />
He sweeps up the poor little pretty faces,<br />
The dear little white-frilled daisy faces;<br />
Says things must be kept in their proper places<br />
He has no frill round his ugly face&mdash;<br />
I wish I could find his proper place!</p>

TOUCHSTONE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a garden,
very strange and fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all the roses summer never brings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The snowy blossom of immortal Springs<br />
Lighted its boughs, and I, even I, was there.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There were new heavens, and the earth was new,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And still I told my heart the dream was true.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when the sun stood still, and Time went
out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a blown candle&mdash;when she came to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the bride-veil of the blossomed tree,<br />
Chill through the garden blew the winds of doubt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when, with starry eyes, and lips too near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She leaned to me, my heart knew what to fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;It is no dream,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What dream had stayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So long?&nbsp; It is the blessed isle that lies<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the tides of twin eternities.<br />
It is our island; do not be afraid!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, then at last my heart was well deceived;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hid my eyes; I trembled and believed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her real presence sanctified my faith,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her very voice my restless fears beguiled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was Life that clasped me when she smiled,<br
/>
But when she said &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo; it was Death.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That, that at least could neither be nor
seem&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, then, indeed, I knew it was a dream!</p>

I love you hot as fire, my girl, and you know you know it too.<br

So won&rsquo;t you name the day?&rdquo;<br />
But I said, &ldquo;That I will not.&rdquo;<br />
And I pushed him away,<br />
Out among the raspberries all on a summer day.<br />
And I says, &ldquo;You ask in winter, if your love&rsquo;s so
hot,<br />
For it&rsquo;s summer now, and sunny, and my hands is

&ldquo;With the fair by and by,<br />

And the fruiting and the harvest home,<br />
And my new white gown to make, and the jam all to be done.<br />
Can&rsquo;t you leave a girl alone?<br />
Your love&rsquo;s too hot for me!<br />
Can&rsquo;t you leave a girl be<br />
Till the evenings do draw in,<br />
Till the leaves be getting thin,<br />

And the winter it come on, and the fires were early lit,<br />
And he&rsquo;d never come anigh again, and all my life was
sick.<br />
And I was cold alone, with nought to do but sit<br />
With my hands in my black lap, and hear the clock tick.<br />
For father, he lay dead<br />
With the candles at his head,<br />
And his coffin was that black I could see it through the wall;<br

And I&rsquo;d sent them all away,<br />
Though they&rsquo;d offered for to stay.<br />
I wanted to be cold alone, and learn to bear it all.<br />
Then I heard him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d a-known it for his footstep
just as plain<br />
If he&rsquo;d brought his regiment with him up the rutty frozen
lane.<br />
And I hadn&rsquo;t drawed the curtains, and I see him through the
pane;<br />
And I jumped up in my blacks and I threw the door back wide.<br

Says I, &ldquo;You come inside;<br />

<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">. . . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I saw in his face<br />
The fear of death, and desire.<br />
And oh, I took and kissed him again and again,<br />
And I clipped him close and all,<br />
In the winter, in the dusk, in the quiet house-place,<br />
With the coffin lying black and full the other side the wall;<br

And &ldquo;<i>You</i> warm my heart,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;if
there&rsquo;s any fire in men!&rdquo;<br />
And he got his two arms round me, and I felt the fire then.<br />
And I warmed my heart at the fire.</p>

Drink deep then, and rest, O thou foolish wayfarer,<br />

You thrill to the rush of white wings, and you hear:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is day, it is day, it has never been
night!<br />
Thou hast dreamed of the night and the wood of lost leaves;<br />
It was always noon, June, and red roses in sheaves,<br />
Unlock the blind lids, and behold the light-bearer<br />
Who holds, like a monstrance, the sun in his hands.&rdquo;</p>

to bed;<br />
There were no soft curtains round her head;<br />
She had no mother to hold of worth<br />
The little baby she brought to birth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Mary of Magdala groaned and prayed:<br />
&ldquo;O God, I am very much afraid;<br />
For out of my body, by sin defiled,<br />
Thou biddest me make a little child.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;O God, I have turned my face from
Thee<br />
To that which the angels may not see;<br />
How can I make, from my deep disgrace,<br />
A child whose angel shall see Thy face?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;O God, I have sinned, and I know well<br

That the pains I bear are the pains of hell;<br />
But the thought of the child that sin has given<br />
Is like the thought of the airs of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

In the clutch of pain like the pains of Death,<br />

Went the pang of joy and the pang of life.</p>

she,<br />

In the little garments that babies wear?&rdquo;</p>

And laid again on his mother&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Now who will sign on his brow the
mark<br />
To keep him safe from the Powers of the Dark?<br />
Who will my baby&rsquo;s sponsor be?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I, the Lord God, who died for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Now who will comfort him if he cry;<br

And who will suckle him by and bye?<br />
For my hands are cold and my breasts are dry,<br />
And I think that my time has come to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I will dandle thy son as a mother
may;<br />
And his lips shall lie where my own Son&rsquo;s lay.<br />
Come, dear little one, come to me;<br />
The Mother of God shall suckle thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Mary of Magdala laughed and sighed;<br />
&ldquo;I never deserved a child,&rdquo; she cried.<br />
&ldquo;Dear God, I am ready to go to hell,<br />
Since with my little one all is well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then the Son of Mary did o&rsquo;er her

<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> I lived in the

There were lilies in all the orchards,<br />
Flowers in the orange-gardens<br />
For brides to wear in their hair.<br />
It was always sunshine and summer,<br />
Roses at every lattice,<br />
Dreams in the eyes of maidens,<br />
Love in the eyes of men.</p>
<p class="poetry">When I lived in the village of youth<br />
The doors, all the doors, stood open;<br />
We went in and out of them laughing,<br />
Laughing and calling each other<br />
To shew each other our fairings,<br />
The new shawl, the new comb, the new fan,<br />
The new rose, the new lover.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now I live in the town of age<br />
Where are no orchards, no gardens.<br />
Here, too, all the doors stand open,<br />
But no one goes in or goes out.<br />
We sit alone by the hearthstone<br />
Where memories lie like ashes<br />
Upon a hearth that is cold;</p>
<p class="poetry">And they from the village of youth<br />
Run by our doorsteps laughing,<br />

Never to be effaced.</p>
<p class="poetry">A wife was mine to my heart,<br />
Beautiful flower of my garden,<br />
Lily I worshipped by day,<br />
Scented rose of my nights.<br />
Now the night wind sighing<br />
Blows white rose petals only<br />
Over the bed where she sleeps<br />
Dreamless alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">I had a son; I loved him.<br />
Mother of God, bear witness<br />
How all my manhood loved him<br />
As thy womanhood loved thy Son!<br />
When he was grown to his manhood<br />
He crucified my heart,<br />
And even as it hung bleeding<br />
He laughed with his bold companions,<br />
Mocked and turned away<br />
With laughter into the night.</p>
<p class="poetry">Those three I loved and lost;<br />

With all the fire of her heart.<br />
Mine was the sacred altar<br />
<a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Where she
burnt her life for my worship.<br />
She was my slave, my servant;<br />
Mine all she had, all she was,<br />
All she could suffer, could be.<br />
That was the love of my life,<br />
I did not say, &ldquo;She loves me&rdquo;;<br />
I was so used to her love<br />
I never asked its name,<br />
Till, feeling the wind blow cold<br />
Where all the doors were left open,<br />
And seeing a fireless hearth<br />
And the garden deserted and weed-grown<br />
That once was full of flowers for me,<br />
I said, &ldquo;What has changed?&nbsp; What is it<br />
That has made all the clocks stop?&rdquo;<br />
Thus I asked and they answered:<br />
&ldquo;It is thy mother who is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And now I am alone.<br />
My son, too, some day will stand<br />
Here, where I stand and weep.<br />
He too will weep, knowing too late<br />
The love that wrapped round his life.<br />
Dear God spare him this:<br />
Let him never know how I loved him,<br />
For he was always weak.<br />
He could not endure as I can.<br />
Mother, my dear, ask God<br />
To grant me this, for my son!</p>

On a lawn of green<br />
White blossoms fall<br />
In the waning light;<br />

Curtains are drawn<br />
From windows bright.<br />
And within she moves with her gracious hands<br />
And the heart that loves and that understands,<br />
Waiting to succour poor souls in need,<br />
And to bind with her blessing the hearts that bleed.</p>

But the tired-out tramp,<br />
Dirty and ill,<br />
In the evening&rsquo;s damp,<br />

Knows not that there<br />
Is the heart to care<br />
For such as I and for such as he.<br />
He slouches along, and sees alone<br />
The gray of the sky and the gray of the stone.</p>

In all Thy world that is now so green,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The terror that walketh by night, and the horror by

The legions of Evil, alert and awake and aware,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Press round him each hour; and I pray here alone,
far away.</p>
<p class="poetry">God! call up Thy legions to fight on the side
of my love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the seats of the mighty be cast down before him,
O Lord,<br />
Send strong wings of angels to shield him beneath and above,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Let glorious Michael unsheath his implacable
sword.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let the whole host of Heaven take part with my
dear in his fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the armies of Hell may be scattered like chaff
in the blast,<br />
And the trumpets of Heaven blow fair for the triumph of Right.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspire him, protect him, and bring him home victor
at last.</p>
<p class="poetry">But if&mdash;ah, dear God, give me strength to
withhold nothing now!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If the life of my life be required for Thy splendid
design,<br />
Give his country the laurels, though cold and uncrowned be his

FIELDS OF FLANDERS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Last</span> year the fields
were all glad and gay<br />
With silver daisies and silver may;<br />
There were kingcups gold by the river&rsquo;s edge<br />
And primrose stars under every hedge.</p>
<p class="poetry">This year the fields are trampled and brown,<br

The hedges are broken and beaten down,<br />
And where the primroses used to grow<br />
Are little black crosses set in a row.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the flower of hopes, and the flowers of
dreams,<br />
The noble, fruitful, beautiful schemes,<br />
The tree of life with its fruit and bud,<br />
Are trampled down in the mud and the blood.</p>
<p class="poetry">The changing seasons will bring again<br />
The magic of Spring to our wood and plain:<br />
Though the Spring be so green as never was seen<br />
The crosses will still be black in the green.</p>
<p class="poetry">The God of battles shall judge the foe<br />
Who trampled our country and laid her low . . .<br />

Just like last year&rsquo;s violets, too,<br />

Body we made with love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soul made with love by Thee.<br />
This was the mystery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In which I worshipped Thy grace;<br />
This was the sign to me&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The unveiling of Thy face . . .<br />
This, that lies under Thy skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Naked as on that day<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; When the world was made new<br />
And Thy word was made flesh for me . . .<br />

Broken, battered, shattered . . .<br />

All that was promised me<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">If</span> Jesus came to
London,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came to London to-day,<br />
He would not go to the West End,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He would come down our way;<br />
He&rsquo;d talk with the children dancing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the organ out in the street,<br />
And say he was their big Brother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give them something to eat.</p>
<p class="poetry">He wouldn&rsquo;t go to the mansions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the charitable live;<br />
He&rsquo;d come to the tenement houses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we ain&rsquo;t got nothing to give.<br />
He&rsquo;d come so kind and so homely,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And treat us to beer and bread,<br />
And tell us how we ought to behave;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we&rsquo;d try to mind what He said.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the warm bright West End churches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They sing and preach and pray,<br />
They call us &ldquo;Beloved brethren,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they do not act that way.<br />
And when He came to the church door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d call out loud and free,<br />
&ldquo;You stop that preaching and praying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And show what you&rsquo;ve done for Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Then they&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;O Lord, we have given<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the poor both blankets and tracts,<br />
And we&rsquo;ve tried to make them sober,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ve tried to teach them facts.<br />
But they will sneak round to the drink-shop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pawn the blankets for beer,<br />
And we find them very ungrateful,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But still we persevere.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then He would say, &ldquo;I told you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The time I was here before,<br />
That you were all of you brothers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All you that I suffered for.<br />
I won&rsquo;t go into your churches,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stop in the sun outside.<br />
You bring out the men your brothers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The men for whom I died!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Out of our beastly lodgings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From arches and doorways about,<br />
They&rsquo;d have to do as He told them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;d have to call us out.<br />
Millions and millions and millions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thick and crawling like flies,<br />
We should creep out to the sunshine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not be afraid of His eyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">He&rsquo;d see what God&rsquo;s image looks
like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When men have dealt with the same,<br />
Wrinkled with work that is never done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swollen and dirty with shame.<br />
He&rsquo;d see on the children&rsquo;s forehead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The branded gutter-sign<br />
That marks the girls to be harlots,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That dooms the boys to be swine.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>Then He&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of
churches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When these have nowhere to sleep?<br />
And how can I hear you praying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When they are cursing so deep?<br />
I gave My Blood and My Body<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That they might have bread and wine,<br />
And you have taken your share and theirs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these good gifts of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then some of the rich would be sorry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all would be very scared,<br />
And they&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;But we never knew, Lord!&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And He&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;You never
cared!&rdquo;<br />
And some would be sick and shameful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they&rsquo;d know that they knew,<br />
And the best would say, &ldquo;We were wrong, Lord.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now tell us what to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I think He&rsquo;d be sitting, likely,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For someone &rsquo;ud bring Him a chair,<br />
With a common kid cuddled up on His knee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the common sun on His hair;<br />
And they&rsquo;d be standing before Him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And He&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;You know that you
knew.<br />
Why haven&rsquo;t you worked for your brothers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The same as I worked for you?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;For since you&rsquo;re all of you
brothers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s clear as God&rsquo;s blessed sun<br />
That each must work for the others,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not thousands work for one.<br />
And the ones that have lived bone-idle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If they want Me to hear them pray,<br />
Let them go and work for their livings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The only honest way!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing new to tell you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You know what I always said&mdash;<br />
But you&rsquo;ve built their bones into churches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stolen their wine and bread;<br />
You with My Name on your foreheads,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Liar, and traitor, and knave,<br />
You have lived by the death of your brothers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These whom I died to save!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I wish He would come and say it;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps they&rsquo;d believe it then,<br />
And work like men for their livings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And let us work like men.<br />
Brothers?&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t believe it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lie on their lips is red.<br />
They&rsquo;ll never believe till He comes again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or till we rise from the dead!</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
